# Logic Simulator

Logic Simulator is a simple program written in Python that emulates electronic logic gates (e.g. AND gate, NOT gate, OR gate, etc.). It can simulate a variety of logic gates and chips ranging from simple AND gates to (somewhat) Complex ALU chips.

## Features

- Simulates basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR)
- Implements a **SR Latch** for sequential logic
- 1-Bit and 4-Bit Binary Adder
- CLI-based user interaction
- Supports **truth tables** for the simple logic gates, as for the more complex ones were calculated using a seperate script and put in respective files.

## Getting Started

The following instructions are designed to get this project up and running on your local system with the recommended program versions, and might not work if you have a different version.

### Prerequisites

Requirements to install and run the program:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) [Recommended: v3.12.6]
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) [Recommended: v2.48.1]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayvn-42/Logic-Simulator.git
cd Logic-Simulator
```
2. Run the simulator
```bash
python main.py
```
And if every thing was set correctly, you should see:
```bash
>
```
and the `>` should be green.

### Testing
To test if the simulator is working run the following help command
```bash
> help
```
and you should see a help menu pop up. If not reinstall the repo and try again.
